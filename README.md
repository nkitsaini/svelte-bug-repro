# Bug Repro
## Setup
```
npm install 
npm run build
npm run preview
```
## Use
Go to the URL where preview is running and use devtools/whatever to limit the network speed. Once the page starts loading and the input box is visible, edit the input box. After a while when page finishes loading, the input box will be automatically cleared.
